# Configurations

Through the `PSFramework` you have a simple method that allows you to ...

 - Publish settings
 - With onboard documentation
 - Input validation
 - Scripts that run on change of settings
 - That can be discovered and updated by the user
 - That can be administrated by policy & DSC

The configuration system is a bit too complex to describe in a help file, you can however visit us at http://psframework.org for detailed guidance.

An example can be seen in the attached ps1 file
