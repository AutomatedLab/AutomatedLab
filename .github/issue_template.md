## Description

<!--
Please describe your issue in as much detail as possible for us to understand it. Please
create **one GitHub issue for each problem you experience**. Otherwise it is hard to track
the progress.
Even though we develop AutomatedLab, we are not clairvoyant and need as many details as
possible to properly troubleshoot your issue. Thanks!

## Environment details

<!-- Ideally, if you can: Upload a support package. ***Be warned, this may contain PII and confidential information***. If
in doubt, have a look at it first.
Support packages can be generated in the same PowerShell session you experience an error in with `New-PSFSupportPackage -Include All`

The support package allows us to retrieve all errors as well as all verbose messages, regardless of whether you have
used the Verbose parameter or not.
